The context: Cost of living data basically tells us how much it really costs to live in a certain place. It's not just about rent; it's about groceries, transportation, and all the stuff that makes up daily life. This info is super important for everyone from governments trying to keep the economy healthy to companies deciding where to set up shop, and even for us regular folks figuring out where we can afford to live comfortably. It's all about understanding how far your money goes, and what kind of life you can build in a particular city or town.
